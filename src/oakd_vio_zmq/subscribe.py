class Subscriber:
    """
    Thread-safe ZeroMQ subscriber for RGBD Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) messages.

    This class continuously listens for multipart RGBD VIO messages from a ZeroMQ
    publisher in the background, while exposing a thread-safe interface to fetch
    only the **latest available frame**. Intermediate frames are automatically
    dropped to maintain real-time performance, making it ideal for applications
    where processing speed may lag behind the incoming data rate.

    The received message typically includes:
        - RGB image (as bytes)
        - Point cloud (as bytes or serialized NumPy array)
        - Transformation matrix (as bytes)
        - Metadata (as a packed message)

    Thread safety is ensured using a `threading.Lock` to synchronize access to
    the shared `_latest_msg` buffer between the background receiving thread and
    the main user thread.

    Attributes:
        _stream_uri (str): Fully qualified ZeroMQ URI (e.g. "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
            resolved from the given `stream_name`.
        _ctx (zmq.Context): ZeroMQ context for managing sockets.
        _socket (zmq.Socket): The subscriber socket used to receive multipart
            messages from the publisher.
        _latest_msg (Optional[list[bytes]]): The most
            recent raw multipart message received. Overwritten continuously by
            the background listener thread.
        _lock (threading.Lock): Synchronization primitive used to protect access
            to `_latest_msg` between threads.
        _running (bool): Indicates whether the background receiving thread is
            currently active.
        _thread (Optional[threading.Thread]): Background thread object responsible
            for receiving and storing the latest messages.
